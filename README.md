## 🧑‍💻 **How to Use It**

Once the project is up and running, you can start using it to process data or make predictions. Here’s an example of how to use it:

### **Image Classification**

For image classification, you can simply pass an image to the model for prediction:

```python
from src.main import classify_image

image_path = "path/to/image.jpg"
prediction = classify_image(image_path)

print(f"Predicted Class: {prediction}")
```

### **Predicting Data Trends**

For trend prediction using your data:

```python
from src.main import predict_trends

data = {"feature1": 10, "feature2": 20}
prediction = predict_trends(data)

print(f"Predicted Trend: {prediction}")
```
